# DecentHome
DecentHome is an opensource Android Launcher which is based on Trebuchet 13 which is based on good old Launcher3.

When I was using my Nexus 4 back in the days I wished for a Launcher that I can order my applications at the drawer
in some order other than alphabetical. Well DecentHome has that capacity like some stock launchers of manifacturers.
Also folders on application  drawe is enabled too.
