# DecentHome
DecentHome is an OpenSource Android Launcher,
which is based on Trebuchet 13,
which is based on good old Launcher3.

When I was using my Nexus 4, back in the days, I wished for an application launcher
that I can order my applications at the drawer in some order other than alphabetical.

Well I created DecentHome which is capable to do so,
like stock launchers of some manifacturers.
Also folders on application  drawer is enabled too.
